Breakdown of How the Leaderboard Functions and Interacts with the Bot
Overview
The leaderboard is a dynamic feature that displays the top traders based on their current balances. It is updated whenever a user's balance changes, such as during registration or balance edits. The leaderboard ensures users can see how they rank compared to other traders.
Components and Flow
1. Initialization
The leaderboard functionality is typically initialized when the bot starts. This involves reading existing data and preparing the leaderboard for updates.
2. Data Storage
The leaderboard relies on two primary JSON files:
players.json: Stores user data, including their balances.
leaderboardMessageId.json: Stores the ID of the message displaying the leaderboard in the Discord channel.
3. Reading Data
The bot reads the players.json file to get the latest user balances.
The bot reads the leaderboardMessageId.json file to retrieve the message ID of the current leaderboard in the Discord channel.
4. Update Trigger Points
The leaderboard is updated at various points:
User Registration (/register command):
When a new user registers or an existing user resets their balance, the leaderboard is updated.
Balance Edit (/editbalance command):
When an admin adjusts a user's balance, the leaderboard is updated.
5. Leaderboard Update Process
Fetch Data:
Read the players.json file to get the latest user data and balances.
Sort Users:
Sort the users by their balance in descending order.
Generate Leaderboard Text:
Create a formatted text string that lists the users and their balances in rank order.
Fetch or Create Leaderboard Message:
Fetch the existing leaderboard message in the designated Discord channel using the message ID from leaderboardMessageId.json.
If the message does not exist (e.g., the ID is invalid or the message was deleted), create a new message in the channel and save its ID to leaderboardMessageId.json.
6. Error Handling
If errors occur during the update process (e.g., file read/write errors, Discord API errors), the bot logs these errors and may notify an admin.
Common errors include file not found errors, message not found errors, and permission issues when trying to read/write data or send messages.
7. Utility Function for Leaderboard Update
A utility function, often named updateLeaderboard, handles the entire process of reading data, sorting users, generating the leaderboard text, and updating the message in Discord.
Detailed Flow of the Leaderboard Update Process
Invocation:
The updateLeaderboard function is called when there is a need to refresh the leaderboard.
Read and Parse Player Data:
The function reads the players.json file.
It parses the file contents into an object to access user balances.
Sort User Balances:
The function sorts the users based on their balances in descending order.
Generate Leaderboard Text:
The function generates a text string that includes each user's rank, username, and balance.
Fetch or Create Leaderboard Message:
The function checks if a leaderboard message ID exists in leaderboardMessageId.json.
If an ID exists, the function tries to fetch the existing message from the Discord channel.
If no ID exists or the message cannot be fetched, the function creates a new leaderboard message in the designated channel and saves the new message ID to leaderboardMessageId.json.
Update the Message:
The function updates the content of the fetched or newly created message with the latest leaderboard text.
Error Handling:
The function includes error handling to manage potential issues during data reading, message fetching, or message updating.
Errors are logged, and critical errors may be reported to an admin for further action.
Summary
The leaderboard functionality integrates with the bot to provide a real-time ranking of users based on their balances. The process involves reading and writing JSON data, interacting with the Discord API to update messages, and handling errors gracefully. The utility function updateLeaderboard centralizes the logic for maintaining the leaderboard, ensuring it remains accurate and up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.
