Send me a detailed overview of the discord bot. Let me know the commands and how they work with an example
flow for each. I need to know how the leaderboard works. I need to know how trading.js works. everything that
you think would be important for someone to know based on what we did here today. Do not leave out any details. 
you can also include a portion with the changes you made to the bot. Do not leave out details refrence the chat
do not send any code I will use the code that you provided me and send it to the person who will be assisting me with
the bot next. Be long winded in your explanation. 

Make sure certain commands are admin only
-Command to show all open trades (ID and Trader) 
-Command to clear a text channel of all messages if applicable

-Is it possible for the recommended tickers to be displayed
when a trader is typing in a trade or act like actions like
the trade command but they can still type if they want to.

-anyway to add a border to a message?
Can the colored portion of the embedd
 message go all the way around

-make sure buttons can only be used by the user who issued the command

-tradingview alerts

-when a user does /trade can the recommended buy or sell have an emoji next to it
like green dot for buy red dot for sell? 

Default embed colors should be blue.
Trades associated with buys should be green.
Trades associated with sells should be red.
Other messages should have relevant colors.
Include relevant emojis to add some flair to the messages.
Change the announcement title to "Welcome!".
Include the Discord server icon at the bottom of the embedded messages.

node bot.js

Do not send code ask any questions you may have 
for clarification and answer my questions. 

Current bugs:

-Duplicate command recommendations when using the /commands I see multiples of the commands. 

-Leaderboard showing as undefined lets make the leaderboard use @mentions to list the players.

-The dropdown for the buy and sell options is gone I dont want them typing it I want two options.
Either they can select Buy or Sell.
